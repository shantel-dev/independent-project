                <h3>SHANTEL KEMUNTO</h3>
                <p>I was born in Kisii County in January 25th 2002. I went to Rockfields Junior School in Umoja,Nairobi for Kindergaten School all the way till I did my K.C.P.E. I was then called to Pangani Girls School where I did my K.C.S.E in 2019. Currently,I am studying Business Information Technology at the KCA University,just finished my first year.I decided to join Moringa first of all,to keep me busy during my long holiday and secondly,to gain knowledge in coding.</p>
